# Python Summaries

## Chapter 1

### why do people use python ?

- Software quality.
- Developer productivity.
- Program portability.
- Support Many Libraries.
- Component intergration.
- Enjoyment .

This is according to Markj Lutz the author of Learning Python pdf.

### WHy should codes follow a good practices in python

This is to ensure:

- Functional Code.
- Readable Code.
- Maintainable Code.
- Robust Code and Secure Code.

The good coding practice principle in python is know as PEP 8 (Python Enhancement Proposal 8).

- Python is a genera-purpose programming langauage that is often applied in scripting roles.

- Python is  a general purpose programming language that i s both compiled and intepreted .
The python script is first compile into byte code which is then interpreted line by line by the python intepreter into machine code.
The byte code is the portable format for python.
And it is because python is not fully compliuled that it turns to be very slow when compare withg other langauges like C or C++.

But python for some task or operations execute a the speed of C code. Since some modules libraries are build in C and C++.
For example performing and operation on a file take sthesame amount of time as doing it on C.

## Chapter 3

The importance of interactive prompt is that it is a condusive enviroment for experiment with python code and also testing python  codes.

To be able to save and rerun you code or script multiple times, it is advisable to store them in a file. A file in python is called a module and are often referred to as programs in python.
